## Objectives and Contextualisation

This course is a standard introduction to Public Sector Economics. Public Finance, or equivalently Public Economics, is the study of the effects of government actions on economic activity. The course thus aims at predicting the effects of such actions in order to provide guidance on the choice between different alternatives. The objective is to provide a toolbox with which to approach in a rigorous way a variety of issues related to the design and evaluation of public policy.
